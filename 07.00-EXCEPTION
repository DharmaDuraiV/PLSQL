EXCEPTION:
------------

Exception is a runtime error that occurs while the PL/SQL program is executing.
PL/SQL provides a way to handle these errors using an EXCEPTION section.
This helps prevent program crashes and allows custom error messages or actions.


THERE ARE 2 TYPES OF EXCEPTIONS SUPPORTED BY ORACLE

1.  	PREDEFINED EXCEPTIONS
2.  	USER-DEFINED EXCEPTIONS
