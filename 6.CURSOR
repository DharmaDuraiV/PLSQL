CURSOR 
Cursor Is A Private Sql Memory Area Which Is Used To Process Multiple Records And Also This Is A Record By Record Process .
THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF STATIC CURSOR SUPPORTS BY ORACLE
1)	IMPLICIT CURSOR
2)	EXPLICIT CURSOR

IMPLICIT CURSOR
-----------------
Sql Statements Returns A Single Record Is Called Implicit Cursors .
Implicit Cursor Are Simple Pl/Sql Programs Which Contains Select Into Clause Or Dml Statements

EXAMPLE:
DECLARE
    V_NAME VARCHAR(20) ;
    V_SAL NUMBER(6);
BEGIN
    SELECT ENAME ,SAL INTO V_NAME ,V_SAL
    FROM EMP
   WHERE EMPNO =&NO ;
       DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE( V_NAME || '  ' ||V_SAL);
END ;
/
O/P :

ENTER VALUE FOR NO: 7369


IMPLICIT CURSOR ATTRIBUTES:
---------------------------

Every Explicit Cursor Having Following Four Attributes:

1) %FOUND
2) %NOTFOUND
3) %ISOPEN
4) %ROWCOUNT

All These Cursor Attributes Using Along With Cursor Name Only.

SYNTAX: 
        SQL%Attribute_Name 

Here are slightly more detailed, yet concise, definitions for each cursor attribute:

1. %NOTFOUND
   Returns `TRUE` if the last `FETCH` did not return any rows (i.e., no data). Returns `FALSE` if rows were fetched.

   Syntax: 
            SQL%NOTFOUND

2. %FOUND  
   Returns `TRUE` if the last `FETCH` successfully fetched at least one row. Returns `FALSE` if no rows were fetched.

   Syntax:
            SQL%FOUND

3. %ISOPEN  
   Returns `TRUE` if the cursor is currently open. Returns `FALSE` if the cursor is closed.

   Syntax: 
            SQL%ISOPEN

4. %ROWCOUNT 
   Returns the number of rows fetched so far from the cursor.

   Syntax: 
            SQL%ROWCOUNT
OLD   7:   WHERE EMPNO =&NO ;
NEW   7:   WHERE EMPNO =7369 ;
SMITH  800
