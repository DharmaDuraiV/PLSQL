ðŸ”¹ What is a Collection in PL/SQL (Oracle)?

In PL/SQL, a collection is a single-dimensional group of elements (like an array) that can hold multiple values of the same data type.

It acts as a container to store and manipulate multiple values together.

Oracle PL/SQL provides 3 types of collections:

      -->1) Associative Arrays (index-by tables)
      -->2) Nested Tables
      -->1) VARRAYs (Variable-size arrays)
-------------------------------------------------------
  ðŸ”¹ Why Collection?
Normally, PL/SQL variables store only one value at a time. But in real-world applications, we often need to handle multiple values (like a list of employee IDs, student marks, product prices, etc.).

Collections help because:
They allow us to store multiple values in one variable.
Improve performance when moving bulk data between SQL and PL/SQL (using BULK COLLECT and FORALL).
Provide flexibility to handle in-memory data like arrays or lists.

  ----------------------------------------------------
  Where do we use Collections?

Collections are commonly used in:

Bulk Data Processing
    Fetching multiple rows from a query into a collection (using BULK COLLECT).

Example: Collecting all employee salaries at once instead of looping row by row.

Batch Operations
    Updating/deleting/inserting many rows efficiently (using FORALL with collections).

Temporary Data Storage
    Holding intermediate results in memory.

Example: Storing marks of students before calculating averages.

Procedures/Functions Parameters
    Passing multiple values (like a list of IDs) into a procedure.

Complex Business Logic
    Handling lookups, transformations, and in-memory computations.
