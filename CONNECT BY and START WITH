CONNECT BY and START WITH

These clauses are used to query hierarchical or tree-structured data.
when a table has a self-referencing relationship like EMP (employee â†’ manager).

Syntax:

  SELECT column1, column2, ...,level
  FROM table_name
  START WITH condition_to_identify_root
  CONNECT BY  PRIOR child_column = parent_column;

START WITH: Specifies the root(s) of the hierarchy (e.g., top-level manager).

CONNECT BY: Defines the relationship between parent and child rows.

PRIOR: Indicates which side of the relationship is parent or child.
The LEVEL pseudocolumn is used with CONNECT BY to indicate the depth of a row in a hierarchical query.
