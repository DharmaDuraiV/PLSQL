What is an Index
   - Index is a database object that improves query performance by providing quick access to rows in a table.
   - It allows faster retrieval of data, especially for large tables.
   - It works similarly to an index in a book, helping you quickly locate specific rows.
   - Indexes are automatically created on primary key and unique key columns.

Types of Indexes:
------------------------------
   - Single-column Index: Created on one column.
   - Composite Index : Created on multiple columns.
   - Unique Index : Ensures values in the indexed column(s) are unique.


Advantages of Indexes:
---------------------------
   - Faster Query Performance: Speeds up data retrieval, especially for SELECT queries with WHERE clauses.
   - Efficient Searching: Reduces full table scans for searches

Syntax for Creating an Index:

   - Basic Syntax:

     CREATE INDEX index_name
     ON table_name (column_name);

   -Composite Index (on multiple columns):
    
     CREATE INDEX index_name
     ON table_name (column_name1, column_name2);
    
   - Unique Index:
    
     CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name
     ON table_name (column_name);
